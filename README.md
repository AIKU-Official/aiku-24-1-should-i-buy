## ü§ó Introduction

This repository is an implementation of the project "So.. should I buy?" by [AIKU](https://aiku.notion.site/AIKU-b614c69220704b848758e5cf21a54238?pvs=74) members, [mung3477](https://github.com/mung3477), [je1att0](https://github.com/je1att0), [iamnotwhale](https://github.com/iamnotwhale), [delaykimm](https://github.com/delaykimm).
<br>

We implemented a model that predicts a bitcoin price flunctutaion using the historical data and bitcoin related articles. The model is based on the Transformer architecture and BERT based models.

### Dataset

We crolled news headlines from [cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin) and [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/).
[TBD]

### Related works

We referred to the following papers and repositories for the implementation.
<br>
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14759) proposed a combination of `Twitter-RoBERTa` & `BART MNLI` for predicting the bitcoin price based on the news articles. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03684.pdf) proposed a attention based model that predicts the bitcoin price based on the historical data.

### Model

-   We used `Twitter-RoBERTa` & `BART MNLI` for the news articles
-   We embedded a market cube with convolutional layers and added position embeddings, and fed the resulting sequence of vectors to a `standard transformer encoder`. In order to perform prediction, we used the standard approach of adding an extra learnable "prediction token" to the sequence.
-   We used MLP to aggregate embeddings and predict a bitcoin price flunctutaion range.
